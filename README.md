The application asks the user to enter the length of the password required. On entering the length, a random password is generated.
Eventlisteners are added to the 'buttons', which are invoked on clicking them.
The password generated is unique and includes uppercase letters,lowercase letters, numbers and special characters.
The unique password can be copied by clicking on the 'Copy to Clipboard' key.
